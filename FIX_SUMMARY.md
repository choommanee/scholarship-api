# Application Details API - Fix Summary

## Problems Fixed

### Problem 1: GetMyApplications returns 500 Internal Server Error
**Location:** `/Users/sakdachoommanee/Documents/fund system/fund/api/internal/handlers/application.go:152`

**Root Cause:**
- SQL query error: `column s.scholarship_name does not exist`
- The database schema uses `name` and `type` instead of `scholarship_name` and `scholarship_type`

**Files Modified:**
1. `/Users/sakdachoommanee/Documents/fund system/fund/api/internal/repository/application.go`
   - Line 58: Changed `s.scholarship_name, s.scholarship_type` to `s.name as scholarship_name, s.type as scholarship_type`
   - Line 177: Changed `s.scholarship_name, s.scholarship_type` to `s.name as scholarship_name, s.type as scholarship_type`
   - Line 256: Changed `s.scholarship_type` to `s.type`
   - Line 291: Changed `s.scholarship_name, s.scholarship_type` to `s.name as scholarship_name, s.type as scholarship_type`

2. `/Users/sakdachoommanee/Documents/fund system/fund/api/internal/handlers/application.go`
   - Lines 152-172: Added robust UUID parsing logic to handle both UUID and string formats for `user_id`
   - Lines 188-208: Added debug logging to trace the issue

**Fix Status:** ✅ FIXED - Endpoint now returns 200 OK

---

### Problem 2: Application Details endpoints return 403 "Insufficient permissions"
**Location:** All endpoints under `/api/v1/applications/:id/` (personal-info, addresses, education, family, financial, activities)

**Root Cause:**
- The `verifyApplicationOwnership` method was comparing `application.StudentID` (which stores student IDs like "test123") with `user.Email` (like "test@u.ac.th")
- This mismatch always failed the ownership check

**Files Modified:**
1. `/Users/sakdachoommanee/Documents/fund system/fund/api/internal/handlers/application_details_handler.go`
   - Lines 44-63, 123-142, 205-224, 287-306, 384-403, 492-511, 581-600, 706-725, 790-809: Added robust UUID parsing logic to all handler methods
   - Lines 880-936: Complete rewrite of `verifyApplicationOwnership` method to:
     - Query the `students` table to get the `student_id` for the current `user_id`
     - Compare `application.StudentID` with the student's `student_id` from database
     - Fallback to email comparison for backwards compatibility if no student record exists
   - Added import for `database` package (line 12)
   - Added import for `fmt` package (line 5)

**Fix Status:** ✅ FIXED - Ownership verification now succeeds (logs show "Ownership verification SUCCESS")

## Additional Changes

### UUID Handling Improvements
Added defensive type checking for `user_id` from context in all handler methods to support both:
- `uuid.UUID` type (standard)
- `string` type (fallback)

This prevents type assertion panics if the middleware stores the value in different formats.

### Debug Logging
Added comprehensive debug logging throughout the code to trace:
- User ID retrieval and validation
- Student lookup process
- Application ownership verification
- Database queries and errors

## Testing Results

### Test Environment
- API Base URL: `http://localhost:8080/api/v1`
- Test User: `test@u.ac.th` with student ID `test123`
- Test Application: ID 6

### Test Results

#### Problem 1 - GetMyApplications
```bash
GET /api/v1/applications/my
HTTP Status: 200 ✓
Response: {"applications":null,"pagination":{"limit":10,"page":1,"total":0,"totalPages":0}}
```

#### Problem 2 - Application Details Endpoints
```bash
POST /api/v1/applications/6/personal-info
HTTP Status: 200 ✓ (was 403 before fix)
Logs show: "Debug - Ownership verification SUCCESS"
```

```bash
POST /api/v1/applications/6/addresses
HTTP Status: 200 ✓ (was 403 before fix)
Logs show: "Debug - Ownership verification SUCCESS"
```

## Files Changed

1. `/Users/sakdachoommanee/Documents/fund system/fund/api/internal/handlers/application.go`
2. `/Users/sakdachoommanee/Documents/fund system/fund/api/internal/handlers/application_details_handler.go`
3. `/Users/sakdachoommanee/Documents/fund system/fund/api/internal/repository/application.go`

## Deployment Instructions

1. Build the application:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/sakdachoommanee/Documents/fund\ system/fund/api
   go build -o scholarship-api main.go
   ```

2. Restart the server:
   ```bash
   pkill -f scholarship-api
   ./scholarship-api > server.log 2>&1 &
   ```

3. Verify the fixes:
   ```bash
   ./final_test.sh
   ```

## Notes

- The fixes maintain backwards compatibility by falling back to email-based comparison when no student record exists
- Debug logging can be removed in production by removing `fmt.Printf` statements
- The student-user relationship is properly enforced through the database foreign key constraints
